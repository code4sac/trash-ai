        <h2>Welcome to Trash AI!</h2>
        <p>
            This is an
            <a href="https://github.com/code4sac/trash-ai">

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
            Trash AI allows you to upload an image containing trash and get back
            data about the trash in the image, including the classification of
            trash and bounding box of where the trash is in the image.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            Trash AI builds a model using the
            <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5">YoloV5 toolset</a>
            trained on the <a href="http://tacodataset.org/">TACO dataset</a>.
            The model takes an image containing trash and returns a list of
            annotations and bounding boxes of trash within the image. The model
            is imported into the front-end
            <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> application where it is
            invoked when an image is uploaded. The Vue application then displays
            the results of the model on the image.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I use Trash AI?</h2>
        <p>
            Trash AI is open source and free to use however you see fit. You may
            classify images and download the data. You may copy and modify the
            code for your own use.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer about uploaded images</h2>
        <p>
            The current version of Trash AI and the model we are using is just a
            start! When you upload an image, we are storing the image and the
            classification in an effort to expand the trash dataset and improve
            the model over time.
        </p>
