# New AWS Deployment Procedure

Edit the [deploy_map.json](../deploy_map.json) file and add the new deployment to the `deployments` section of the object.
The branch will need to start with `aws/` for the Github deployment process to
work.

using the following project as an example:

```
https://github.com/shollingsworth/trash-ai
                                  ^ `github_repo_name`
                   ^ `github_repo_owner`
```

| Deployment Field Key | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| aws_account_number   | AWS numeric account number                                                     |
| branch               | github branch, if hosted in aws, branch prefix must be `aws/`                  |
| dns_domain           | Route53 hosted domain name, normal branches will map to only `branch.<domain>` |
| dns_domain_map_root  | map `<domain>`, `www.<domain>` in addition to `branch.<domain>`                |
| github_repo_name     | github repo name                                                               |
| github_repo_owner    | organization / individual owner                                                |

## Step 5 - While your waiting, set branch protection rule for aws branches

-   In the Github Repo
    -   Go to The `Settings` tab
    -   Select the `branches` menu item
    -   Click `Add rule` in section `Branch protection rules`
    -   Set Pattern as `aws/**`
    -   At a minimum set `Reuire pull request before mergine`
    -   Set any other requirements for branch such as signing commits

---

## Step 6 - Wait

-   Grab a coffee, first run will take ~15 - 20 minutes

## Step 7 - SSL Configuration

You may need to configure a CNAME in route53 in order to active the domain in Amplify

-   Navigate in AWS to Amplify -> trash-ai-\* -> Domain management
-   Follow the instructions for SSL Configuration (if the domain is not activated)
