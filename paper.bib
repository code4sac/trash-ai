  abstract = "Despite global efforts to monitor, mitigate against, and prevent
              trash (mismanaged solid waste) pollution, no harmonized trash
              typology system has been widely adopted worldwide. This impedes
              the merging of datasets and comparative analyses. We addressed
              this problem by 1) assessing the state of trash typology and
              comparability, 2) developing a standardized and harmonized
              framework of relational tables and tools, and 3) informing
              practitioners about challenges and potential solutions. We
              analyzed 68 trash survey lists to assess similarities and
              differences in classification. We created comprehensive
              harmonized hierarchical tables and alias tables for item and
              material classes. On average, the 68 survey lists had 20.8\% of
              item classes in common and 29.9\% of material classes in common.
              Multiple correspondence analysis showed that the 68 surveys were
              not significantly different regarding organization type,
              ecosystem focus, or substrate focus. We built the Trash Taxonomy
              Tool (TTT) web-based application with query features and open
              access at openanalysis.org/trashtaxonomy. The TTT can be applied
              to improve, create, and compare trash surveys, and provides
              practitioners with tools to integrate datasets and maximize
              comparability. The use of TTT will ultimately facilitate
              improvements in assessing trends across space and time,
              identifying targets for mitigation, evaluating the effectiveness
              of prevention measures, informing policymaking, and holding

    abstract = {Abstract Quantifying plastic pollution on surface water is essential to understand and mitigate the impact of plastic pollution to the environment. Current monitoring methods such as visual counting are labor intensive. This limits the feasibility of scaling to long-term monitoring at multiple locations. We present an automated method for monitoring plastic pollution that overcomes this limitation. Floating macroplastics are detected from images of the water surface using deep learning. We perform an experimental evaluation of our method using images from bridge-mounted cameras at five different river locations across Jakarta, Indonesia. The four main results of the experimental evaluation are as follows. First, we realize a method that obtains a reliable estimate of plastic density (68.7\% precision). Our monitoring method successfully distinguishes plastics from environmental elements, such as water surface reflection and organic waste. Second, when trained on one location, the method generalizes well to new locations with relatively similar conditions without retraining (≈50\% average precision). Third, generalization to new locations with considerably different conditions can be boosted by retraining on only 50 objects of the new location (improving precision from ≈20\% to ≈42\%). Fourth, our method matches visual counting methods and detects ≈35\% more plastics, even more so during periods of plastic transport rates of above 10 items per meter per minute. Taken together, these results demonstrate that our method is a promising way of monitoring plastic pollution. By extending the variety of the data set the monitoring method can be readily applied at a larger scale.},
